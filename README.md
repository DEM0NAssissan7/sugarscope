# SugarScope
_A gift to Dr. Richard K Bernstien._

## Synopsis
Glucograf has been used by Dr. Bernstein and his patients for decades. However, as technology evolved, it has become far more convenient to use our mobile devices and computers to track glucose information. SugarScope is the spiritual successor to Dr. Bernstein's Glucograf, and it carries far more with it than just a pretty user interface.
This project contains both the backend and the frontend- both open source- that the application uses.

## Goals
This project serves one main goal: make tracking blood glucose data as easy and effortless as possible for both the doctor and the patient.
To accomplish this goal, the project has a few main objectives:

1. Simple and intuitive user interface
2. Providers can seamlessly print glucose data
3. Synchronization between devices, regardless of platform


## User Interface Goals
- Primarily mobile-focused
- Display current glucose data on-screen
  - Automatically detect when the patient's day starts and ends
- One big button to allow users to input some kind of event. Timestamping is automatic, but editable.
